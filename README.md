## Environment Setup

### Install Docker and Conda 
- Ensure your machine has the [Docker environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and the [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.

### Install Airbyte 
- You can deploy Airbyte Open Source by following the [official documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/getting-started/oss-quickstart).  
*Note:* You may need to add `sudo` before `abctl` commands.

### Setup Airbyte 

- Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your web browser. Set your username. To retrieve your password, execute:
  ```bash
  (sudo) abctl local credentials
  ```

- In the Airbyte UI, go to Builder > Import a YAML. 
Upload the YAML file located at ./setup/elt_bench.yaml.
Click on the Publish button, type ignore warnings, and publish it to your workspace.

- In the Airbyte UI, go to **Sources > Custom > ELT Bench**. Retrieve the Workspace ID and Definition ID from the URL:
  ```
  http://localhost:8012/workspaces/<workspace_id>/source/new-source/<api_definition_id>
  ```
  Update the file `./setup/airbyte/airbyte_credentials.json` by filling in the following information: username, password, workspace ID, and API definition ID.


### Install psql
- To insert data into PostgreSQL without installing the complete PostgreSQL database server, you can use the `psql` command-line tool. 
Please refer to the [installation instructions](https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-to-install-psql-on-mac-ubuntu-debian-windows) to install `psql` on your machine.
After successful installation, you can confirm the installation by running:

  ```bash
  psql --version
  ```

### Set up data destination - Snowflake
- Refer to the example in `./setup/destination/setup.sql`. Copy all the contents into a Snowflake worksheet and execute "Run all" to create the necessary credentials.

- Fill in the required values in `./setup/destination/snowflake_credential` to ensure Airbyte can successfully connect to Snowflake.

### Run ELT setup
- Execute the script to create Docker containers for various sources, download both source data and ground truth results for evaluation, and insert the data.
  ```bash
  cd ./setup
  bash elt_setup.sh
  ```

## Evaluation
### Install inspect-ai
```
git clone https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai.git
cd inspect_ai
pip install -e .
```

### Running experiments
```
inspect eval eltbench.py@eltbench --model=openai/gpt-4o
```
Replace the model with your own model if needed.
