Analysis of Each Solution\n\n   \u2022 Solution 1 (Recursive):\n     \u2013 Pros: Straightforward recursive definition that closely matches the mathematical concept.  \n     \u2013 Cons: Python has a default recursion limit, so for large n, it may fail. Also, function-call overhead may make it slower than an iterative approach for big n.\n\n   \u2022 Solution 2 (Iterative):\n     \u2013 Pros: Uses a simple loop, which avoids hitting recursion limits and generally runs efficiently in Python. Easy to understand.  \n     \u2013 Cons: Slightly more verbose than a direct library call, but still clear and robust for all non-negative n within reasonable bounds.\n\n   \u2022 Solution 3 (Built-in math.factorial):\n     \u2013 Pros: Relies on a well-tested, optimized C-implementation in the standard library. Has the best performance and is the simplest to write.  \n     \u2013 Cons: Not a custom implementation (if you specifically need to demonstrate how factorial can be computed manually, this hides the details).\n\n2. Comparison and Contrast\n\n   \u2022 Recursion (Solution 1) is elegant but can be less optimal in Python for large numbers due to recursion limits and call overhead.  \n   \u2022 Iteration (Solution 2) is typically the standard custom approach for factorial: straightforward, efficient, and safe from recursion depth issues.  \n   \u2022 The built-in approach (Solution 3) is simplest and fastest overall, but if there is a requirement to implement factorial logic manually, it does not expose the underlying algorithm.\n\n3. Majority Vote\n\n   Based on typical preferences when writing a manual factorial (i.e., not using math.factorial), an iterative implementation is commonly considered the most practical and robust custom approach. Therefore, the majority vote solution here is:\n\n<solution_index>2</solution_index>",
