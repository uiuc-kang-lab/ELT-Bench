<uploaded_files>
{location}
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a ELT project codebase in the directory {location} (not in /tmp/inputs).

You are a data engineer skilled in databases, SQL, and building ELT pipelines.
You are starting in the {location} directory, which contains all the necessary information for your tasks. However, you are only allowed to modify files in {location}/elt.
Your goal is to build an ELT pipeline by extracting data from multiple sources, such as custom APIs, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, flat files, and the cloud service S3.
The extracted data will be loaded into a target system, Snowflake, followed by writing transformation queries to construct final tables for downstream use.
This task is divided into two stages:
1. Data Extraction and Loading – Using Airbyte's Terraform provider.
2. Data Transformation – Using the DBT Project workflow for Snowflake.


# Stage 1: Data Extraction and Loading Hints#
1. Initialize the Airbyte Provider: Use {location}/config.yaml to configure the username, password, and server URL in {location}/elt/main.tf. You can refer to {location}/documentation/airbyte_Provider.md, then run `terraform init`.
 • Important: You must not modify any provided code in {location}/elt/main.tf.
2. Configure Sources and Destinations: Use {location}/config.yaml to set up the listed sources and destinations in {location}/elt/main.tf. The values in config.yaml represent the actual configurations required for the project.
3. Refer to Documentation for Configuration Guidance: You must consult the Airbyte documentation located in {location}/documentation to understand how to configure sources and destinations.
 • Important: The values in the documentation are for reference only. DO NOT use them directly. Instead, fill in the fields based on the field names in {location}/documentation and the values specified in {location}/config.yaml. The field names in {location}/documentation and {location}/config.yaml may not match exactly. In such cases, you need to infer values for certain fields.
4. Establish Connections: After creating sources and destinations, establish connections between them by following {location}/documentation/connection.md. For each connection, include the name and sync_mode fields in configuration.streams to streamline only the tables defined in {location}/config.yaml.
5. Apply the Configuration: Once all necessary configurations are written, run `terraform apply` to create the resources.
6. Retrieve Connection IDs: After successfully creating sources, destinations and connections, obtain the connection IDs for all newly created connections from the terraform.tfstate file, as these will be needed to trigger the jobs.
7. Trigger All Sync Jobs Using the Airbyte API: Use the Airbyte API along with the retrieved connection IDs to trigger all jobs. Refer to {location}/documentation/trigger_job.md and use {location}/config.yaml to retrieve the required values.
8. Monitor Job Status: Check the status of all triggered jobs by running `python {location}/check_job_status.py --server <server> --username <username> --password <password>`. Replace <server>, <username>, and <password> with the actual values. Proceed to the next stage only if all data extraction and loading jobs are successful. Otherwise, fix any failed jobs.
9. Error Handling: If an error occurs, DO NOT modify any provided files. Instead, verify the configuration against the provided documentation and review previous steps to identify and resolve the issue. If the issue persists after multiple retries, terminate the task.
 
#  Stage 2: Data Transformation Hints#
1. Initialize the DBT Project: Set up a new DBT project by configuring it with {location}/config.yaml, and remove the example directory under the models directory.
2. Understand the Data Model: Review data_model.yaml in {location} to understand the required data models and their column descriptions. Then, write SQL queries to generate these defined data models, referring to the files in the {location}/schemas directory to understand the schemas of source tables. If you have doubts about the schema, use SF_SAMPLE_ROWS to sample rows from the table.
 • Important: Write a separate query for each data model, and if using any DBT project variables, ensure they have already been declared.
3. Validate Table Locations: Ensure all SQL queries reference the correct database and schema names for source tables. If you encounter a "table not found" error, refer to {location}/config.yaml to obtain the correct configuration or use SF_GET_TABLES to check all available tables in the database. If the table does not exist, the issue is likely due to a failure in data extraction and loading in Stage 1, and you should return to Stage 1 to resolve it.
4. Run the DBT Project: Execute `dbt run` to apply transformations and generate the final data models in Snowflake, fixing any errors reported by DBT.
5. Verify Results: Check the generated data models in Snowflake by running queries using SNOWFLAKE_EXEC_SQL, ensuring that column names, and table contents match the definitions in {location}/data_model.yaml. Review and adjust DBT SQL queries if issues arise.
6. Terminate the Task: Terminate the task if all transformations align with data_model.yaml and the final tables in Snowflake are accurate and verified. Alternatively, terminate if you are unable to resolve the issues after multiple retries.

Make sure to call the complete tool when you are done with the task, or when you have an answer to the question. 
***At each step, only one of tool_calls or content should be present.***
