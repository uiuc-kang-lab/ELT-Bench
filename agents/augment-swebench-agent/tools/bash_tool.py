"""Bash tool for executing shell commands.

This completes the implementation specified in Anthropic's blogpost:
https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/swe-bench-sonnet.

This tool allows the agent to execute bash commands in a controlled environment.
It provides a simple interface for running shell commands and getting their output.
It also supports command filters for transforming commands before execution.
